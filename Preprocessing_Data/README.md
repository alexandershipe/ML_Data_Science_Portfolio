Here is some data I have preprocessed/cleaned.

Steps in Data Preprocessing

Step 1 : Import the libraries
Step 2 : Import the data-set
Step 3 : Check out the missing values
Step 4 : See the Categorical Values and split or merge categories if necessary

Step 5 : Splitting the data-set into Training and Test Set
Step 6 : Feature Scaling
